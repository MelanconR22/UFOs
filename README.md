# UFOs

# Overview of Project: 

Dana is a data journalist who has the freedom to write about the content she prefers to write about.  When given the opportunity to write about her hometown of McMinnville, Oregon, she jumps at the opportunity.  McMinnville is famous for their UFO sightings and even have an annual festival for UFO enthusiasts.  Dana has access to a JavaScript file that is filled with UFO sighting information such as date, city, state and even the shape of the UFO.  

The purpose of this project is to build a dynamic webpage that accepts user inputs and adjusts accordingly to show the UFO data requested.

# Results: 
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation:

There are multiple ways to sort through the data and filter the user search results.  You can search by date, city, state, country, and shape. The following is an example of results from using the date search filter:

The following shows results from using the state filter:

The following shows results from using the shape filter:

You can also add multiple filters to your search.  In the example below, the state filter was used to search for sightings in the state of New Mexico.  In the first New Mexico state only search, two results were produced.  One sighting was reported in Albuquerque on 1/1/2010 as well as a sighting in Tularosa on 1/10/2010.  For this search, the state filter was set to New Mexico and the date filter with the date of 1/10/2010.  The results show only the sighting reported on 1/10/2010 from Tularosa, NM.

# Summary: 
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
