Dana is a data journalist who has the freedom to write about the content she prefers to write about.  When given the opportunity to write about her hometown of McMinnville, Oregon, she jumps at the opportunity.  McMinnville is famous for their UFO sightings and even have an annual festival for UFO enthusiasts.  Dana has access to a JavaScript file that is filled with UFO sighting information such as date, city, state and even the shape of the UFO.
